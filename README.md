[Link to Website] {https://      }

Screenshot of Website:




The codebase was developed to present developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about their work and how to contact them.

When the user clicks the links in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

The first application image is larger in size than the others

When the applications are clicked, they take you to the deployed applications. For this assignment I only have one deployed application, so all applications link to that site.

When the user resizes the page or view the site on various screens and devices, they are presented with a responsive layout that adaps to their viewport.
